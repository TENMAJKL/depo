# Depo
Depo is simple JavaScript file that lets you import html from other files\
Version 1.0.0

## Installation
Installation is pretty basic\
Just add `<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TENMAJKL/depo/master/src/depo.js"></script>` to end of your main file where you want to import




## Example

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title></title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>I'm going to add some html using Depo</h2>
    <import file="hi.html">
</body>
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TENMAJKL/depo/master/src/depo.js"></script>
</html>

<!-- hi.html -->

<h2>Here it is</h2>
```

I have no idea why would you use it, but it was my dream to have it before i started doing php/vue
